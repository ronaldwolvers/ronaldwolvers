Language-agnostic software developer with passion for all things programming. Strong interest in the Java, Android/Kotlin & Go ecosystems, Multiplatform frameworks such as CMP and React, as well as a personal love for learning and experimenting with graphics programming in OpenGL & Vulkan.
If you are looking for open source contributors to a project that would help the world, by all means reach out to me, it would be great to speak and be able to help you. 
Or if you know of any great MIDI library _or_ would just like to have a chat!
